### Workflow

* pnt-to-pkz

  Convert a .pnt to a (much smaller) .pkz file.

* pkz-avg

  Compute averages of pkz files.
  
* compute-22year-running-averages

  Compute 22year running averages of all the yearly average pkz files in data/final; store results
  in data/intermediate/22year-running-averages.

* pkz-subtract

  Compute the difference of two pkz files.
  
* compute-22year-anomalies

  Compute the difference of each 22year running average pkz file in data/intermediate/22year-running-averages
  with the 1901-1960 average data/final/tavg-1901-1960.pkz 

* pkz-to-contour-json

  Load a single pkz file and generate a json contour file from it.

* jsonify-22year-anomalies

  Run pkz-to-contour-json on each pkz file found in data/final/22year-anomalies, generating
  the corresponding json file, which will also be stored in data/final/22year-anomalies.

* dopages

  Use phantomjs to render an image for each contour json file in data/final/22year-anomalies;
  store the images in data/final/22year-anomaly-images.

* generate-animated-gif

  Generate a single animated gif image from all the images found in data/final/22year-anomaly-images
